            "title": "Beyond Relational with Entity Framework - Working with JSON, Spatial data and Full-Text Search",
            "description": "Entity Framework Core is great for performing crud operations, but did you know that you can go beyond basic relational queries with Entity Framework Core? Do you need to store and query non-structured data in JSON documents? Or perhaps you want to store spatial data and find the nearest points of interest to a given location? What if you have lots of records and need to sift through them and run full-text search queries? Are you required to keep historical information about data that has been modified or maybe even deleted? If you answered Yes to any of the above questions, this is the workshop you do not want to miss.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, you will see how to achieve each of the above goals with Entity Framework Core. Specifically, I will step through and show how you can use Entity Framework Core for JSON documents, how to use NetTopologySuite for spatial data, make use of temporal tables to keep the complete history of your data and work with full-text search.\r\n\r\nDevelopers working with Entity Framework Core will learn how to store data in JSON columns and how easily you can drill into the JSON data with familiar LINQ query syntax. You will see how to filter and sort results based on elements of the JSON document, project elements from JSON, and even update the JSON document. I will show how to store spatial data with Entity Framework Core and run spatial queries with Entity Framework Core. I will also demonstrate how easy it is to run full-text search queries to find exact or partial matches for your search term and how to set up full-text query indexes. Furthermore, you will see how temporal tables can store all the historical data and how straightforward it is to query for historical records with Entity Framework Core.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a demo-rich workshop and learn about Entity Framework Core features that you will be able to apply right after the workshop.",

Over a full day, you will dive into all things identity related in Azure, how to set it up, maintain it and how to use it in your apps! This is a practical workshop, taking your through the basics of identity, showing you how to configure Azure AD and how to use it in your applications. \r\n\r\nYou will not only learn how to use Azure Active Directory to protect your apps, but also to protect the environment they run in and how to use Azure AD to enforce policies for resource access. \r\n\r\nSome of what you will learn:\r\n• The basics of OAUTH/OpenID.\r\n• Identity concepts in Azure Active Directory.\r\n• How to integrate your applications with Azure AD and use single-sign-on (SSO).\r\n• How to secure your APIs using Azure AD.\r\n• Several ways of granularly granting permissions to various resources, both by role, application or user. \r\n• What is the difference between an app registration and a service principal?\r\n• Getting rid of passwords and using managed identities.\r\n• Using identity to access Azure resources\r\n• Role-based access control\r\n• Granting access to external collaborators. \r\n• Implementing just-in-time, auditable permissions for protected resources.\r\n\r\nThere will be hands-on labs you can do on-site and take home with you to reinforce the concepts and techniques you learn. \r\n\r\nWho is this for?\r\nDevelopers who want to get a better understanding of how Azure Active Directory identity works and how to use it to secure their applications and environments. \r\n\r\nWhile the concepts can be used with any language, the workshop examples and labs will be in C# on the .NET platform.\r\n\r\nNo prior knowledge about Azure Active Directory or identity assumed. Basic programming skills and familiarity with C# necessary to follow code examples and do the hands-on labs.\r\n\r\nTo do the labs you will need to bring a computer with the latest .NET SDK and the editor of your choice (for instance Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider or VS Code).

Are you no longer learning or growing at work? Do you want to change jobs but don’t know where to start? Do you feel stuck on a narrowly-defined path that doesn’t excite you? Whether you're just starting out or are the most experienced person on your team, this workshop will help you determine what's next in your career.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of guided exercises and discussions, you’ll examine your technical and professional strengths, preferences, and dislikes. You’ll reflect on your values and how they apply to your career. Along the way, discover how to do more of what you enjoy at your current job. Finally, you will learn about finding new opportunities with your employer or whether to seek something entirely new. Though you may not leave knowing exactly what you want to be when you grow up, you will leave with a clear plan for getting closer to that dream job.",

You write code to define systems, networks, security groups, firewalls, and more, making standing up an environment repeatable and reusable. Red Hat Ansible lets you remotely interact with those systems you stood up, configuring them, installing and upgrading software, and doing all sorts of system administration and maintenance tasks all using code. No more logging in to dozens of servers to update a package on each- Ansible can handle it from a central location without the risk of typos or missed steps. \r\nJoin Gene Gotimer as we start building infrastructure using code. We’ll instantiate a cloud environment, set up the network and security, and then build and configure an application on top of it. Along the way, we’ll use tools to ensure we are following recommended practices and creating a maintainable ecosystem with easy-to-follow code. You won’t be a master by the end of the half-day, but you will understand the basics and start to be comfortable with infrastructure-as-code.\r\nThis is a hands-on workshop. You’ll need a laptop with an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA) and an SSH client (e.g., PuTTY or OpenSSH, which is included in Git for Windows).\r\n",

We'll learn a bunch of techniques and then we'll finish off by using them to solve a fun data science problem of our own.",

We'll explain what Cypress is doing as it executes your tests, and cover many Cypress basics like commands, assertions, time-travel debugging, and network stubbing. \r\n\r\nWe'll also talk about decision making in testing, how to avoid testing too much or too little in complex, component-driven frameworks. When end-to-end and component tests are running in the same browser, using the same commands, we have some new options for code sharing and test organization.\r\n\r\nMost of all, this workshop teaches testing in a way that is formed around a practical front-end development workflow. We will start from a design and requirements for a small widget we have to build, go to a set of well tested components that meet the requirements, and place the widget in a full page content for end-to-end testing.",

Meet the fastest stack you've never heard of: Firebase, Expo, React Native, and Ignite- the FERNI Stack. This fast-paced session will walk you through writing a messaging app front-end in React Native that uses Firebase for authentication, data storage, and API. Then we'll learn how to build and deploy the app to web, iOS, and Android in a flash with the help of Expo. Throughout our journey, we'll be taking advantage of the smarts and scalability built into the Ignite boilerplate generator. This is a great session for anyone looking for shortcuts for their next hackathon project, as well as those interested in learning about any of the aforementioned technologies through realistic hands-on examples.",

You are going to learn what Spring is used for and how it can make you a more productive developer. It does this by providing you with the infrastructure to build enterprise-ready applications and allowing you to focus on features.\r\n\r\nAfter an introduction to Spring, you will get familiar with the framework by building out a practical application. Along the way, you will learn about the core principles of Spring like Inversion of Control (IoC), dependency injection, beans, application context, and more.\r\n\r\nBuilding a new application isn’t much use if you can’t get it to production. You will learn about the different approaches to moving your application to the greatest place on the planet, production! By the end of this session, you will have what you need to start building enterprise-grade applications with Spring.",

Being aware of the myriad vulnerabilities within our codebase is becoming more and more important for developers to understand in our “shift-left” world. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities haven’t changed in a long time, because none of us seem to get it right. In this workshop we will take a journey through the entire SDLC with a critical eye on security.\r\nWe’ll look at how to implement secure coding practices, and then move on to discuss the ins and outs of modern continuous integration. After we lock down our CI pipelines, we’ll look at how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. Armed with that information we’ll learn how to properly triage threats, exploits, vulnerabilities that affect our software, and how to streamline code improvements. Before we’re done, we’ll investigate modern processes for continuous deployment, including secure infrastructure as code development and how to lock down our CD pipelines.\r\nThis workshop will get hands-on with a simple, streamlined approach to deploying code to the cloud while diving deep into essential concepts related to software security.",

            "description": "Many developers look at the architect role as a next logical progression in a career; some engineers are placed in this role just by virtue of being the longest-tenured member of the team.  Other architects may be in role but are challenged to lead a complete architecture team, only having experience with a limited set of patterns or exposure to the business side.  This workshop will use a set of katas – or practical sessions – where you try out the key techniques, experiencing the technology and leadership changes required to successfully be a chief architect for a portfolio of products.  \r\n\r\nThough this may sound like a workshop in human dynamics and less technical, you will need your laptop, VS .NET, Docker and other tools.  After each section introduces a kata, you will build and/or test a technical implementation based on a case study.  Be prepared to grow your skills and have some of your thoughts about architecture challenged.\r\n\r\nWe will have discussions on platforms, experience APIs, microservice design, event-driven architecture, code patterns, identity management, data management, BFF, CQRS, and more.  You will build simplified versions of some of these and will present findings to your fellow workshop participants.  The workshop is structured in 4 sections (listed below), each having 2 exercises.  \r\n\r\n1.\tThinking like an architect: patterns, defining & alignment to the technology stack, standards (when and when not to), identifying reality in a project lifecycle (and how to correct), and katas on [1] defining the user journey & service blueprint, and [2] developing the system diagram for different application types \r\n\r\n2.\tPractice of architecture: architecture in Agile/SAFe, WTF is architecture runway?, making better decisions based on context/team skills/value/time horizons, speed of the architecture process, coaching the team, and katas on [3] alternative assessments, and [4] running an ARB\r\n\r\n3.\tDesigning for quality: quality attributes including security, telemetry, idempotency, reliability, information architecture (social platforms, relational, fraud detection), and katas on [5] road mapping a security assessment, [6] design for scalability\r\n\r\n4.\tMatching technology to business value: cloud native systems, containers, digital transformation, platform-building, and katas on [7] microservices (why you’re not Netflix and that’s an ok thing), and [8] legacy debt",

Make that weeks.\r\n\r\nUsing open-source tools and cloud services means we can run faster and with more confidence. We can launch a minimal viable product based on years of well-tested code in mere hours.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll create a new React JS single-page application, host it and some lambda functions on Netlify, and add Auth0 and Stripe to handle the vast majority of the functionality. No additional database will be required to get this fully functional web store up and running!",

            "description": "Are you someone who learns better by building something hands-on? This workshop will teach you how to build and manage your data infrastructure using open source tools.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is divided into five modules:\r\n\r\nModule 1: Overview of the workshop and setting up the environment (managed data services for the demo).\r\n\r\nModule 2: Infrastructure as Code: Use Terraform to build, configure, and destroy data infrastructure.\r\n\r\nModule 3: Secret Management: Use Vault to create dynamic secrets to enforce time-bound access to cloud data resources.\r\n\r\nModule 4: Policy as Code: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) to decouple policy from the application code and apply fine-grained access control to your data infrastructure.\r\n\r\nModule 5: Observability: Send your data infrastructure logs to OpenSearch for powerful log analytics.\r\n\r\nEach module can be designed to take between 30 and 45 minutes. Overall, the workshop will take 3–4 hours to complete. Attendees will be given access to all resources (likely a GitHub repository and a few documentation links) for them to continue working on the workshop after the event, if they want to do so. \r\n",

We’ll walk through setting up a new Android project in Android Studio, building a UI with Compose, and integrating and using the default Image Labeling Vision API in our app. Then we'll dive in and train our own custom model and update our application. And finally, we'll explore processing real time camera input in our app.",

In today’s market it is very important for these web applications to be performant, deliver an excellent user experience, and have great discovery through SEO to remain competitive.\r\n\r\nMany development teams have adopted React as a solution to build these applications, as it has remained a very popular solution throughout recent years. However, since most of these apps  are being rendered on the client side, we have started to experience several challenges.\r\n\r\nWhat if there are better ways to improve performance and user experience along with great developer experience? Thankfully with concepts like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR) it is now possible to address the above-mentioned challenges. Today, frameworks like Next.js have been able to revolutionize the way we build React applications.\r\n\r\nCome join me in discussing where we are headed with the future of React applications and how Next.js can help us get there.",

Take away the guesswork involved in caring for your houseplants while also gaining valuable experience in building a practical, event-driven pipeline in your own home! This talk explores the process of building a houseplant monitoring and alerting system using a Raspberry Pi and Apache Kafka. \r\n\r\nMoisture and temperature readings are captured from sensors in the soil and streamed into Kafka. From here, we’ll use stream processing to transform the data, creating a summary view of the current state and driving real-time push alerts to your phone through Telegram. In this session, I’ll talk about how I ingest the data, followed by the tools – including ksqlDB and Kafka Connect – that help transform the raw data into useful information, and finally I’ll show how to use Kafka Producers and Consumers to make the entire application more interactive.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you’ll have everything you need to start building practical streaming pipelines in your own home. Roll up your sleeves – let’s get our hands dirty!",

With some of the recent data leaks, and the astronomical fines associated with them, users and businesses want to know that their data is safe and secure. As a developer, though, security sometimes comes as an afterthought. Customers don’t necessarily feel like this is a feature worth working on early on, and they might be right in a sense. Cryptography is a complex world, but it doesn’t have to be complicated to implement. In this talk, the speaker will introduce the basic concepts of hashing and encryption and will follow to present how to use those encryption algorithms to store data in a database securely. RSA, TLS, SHA, and AES; all these acronyms will have no secret for you after this talk.",

Sure, we can follow the typical QA model and just stop bugs from happening at the end, OR we can advocate for quality at all stages of a project in order to outperform and transform! \r\n\r\nEnsuring the quality of a product is difficult to do if you only begin to worry about it at the end of a project, and yet the QA role that is tasked with ensuring quality is traditionally treated as the last stop for development. Instead, it is better for QA to be involved in advocating for the quality of the product from the very first stages. What does quality advocacy look like? How do you implement it and continue to engage with all factors of discovery and development throughout the duration of a project? Finally, what are the benefits of having quality advocacy as opposed to traditional quality assurance? Quality Assurance is a team effort; therefore strong relationships between  Quality Assurance Analysts and Developers are vital. \r\n",

With the advent of the JSON data type, developers now have a powerful set of functions to update, retrieve, and filter data based on values stored in a JSON blob. In this session, we discuss storing JSON in our database and how the tools in MySQL can make that task a bit easier. We will start with a discussion of why you might want to store data as JSON as opposed to other storage methods. We will then talk about the different ways in which MySQL can help us achieve that goal and how we might go about deciding what method is best. We will see examples of using the JSON data type to store data in a 'normal' table and use SQL commands to retrieve filter, and sort that data. We will also show how you can validate your JSON schema.",

            "description": "Troubleshooting problems in existing applications is no fun. Worst, it happens at 3AM and creates a time crunch to come up with a solution. Wouldn't it be nice if you could predict these issues before they happened?\r\nEnter modeling. Modeling is a powerful tool for predicting the behavior of an application or system developing and deploying it. Modeling allows you to analyze potential issues before they occur, rather than waiting until something goes wrong. Tweaking the model or its parameters lets you explore your system safely, without risking production changes.\r\n\r\nThis talk will dives into modeling system behavior using Python with common libraries. Combining simple techniques with visualizations you will be able to study your own applications before you ever built them (or after - that works too!)\r\n\r\nAdopting a modeling mindset to existing and new systems will put you on the path to designing better applications and give you the confidence that the design will work in real life.",

This tutorial will give developers insight into the tools and strategies used to make using DevOps within their SDLC process as easy as possible! \r\n\r\nThe argument for combining development and operations management to create DevOps is simple: why not avoid the war zone altogether? Time wasted in conflict between teams can lead to costly delays, hindering your ability to effectively deploy software. By bringing both areas of expertise together, everyone benefits from improved communication leading to successful releases free of warfare!\r\n\r\nNot sure what this whole ‘DevOps’ thing is? Join me for an overview of how it works in today's tech world.",

            "description": "When it comes to privacy, encrypted data-in-transit (eg: HTTPS) or encrypted data-at-rest (eg: encrypted hard-disks) schemes provide sufficient cryptographic guarantees in the battle to protect it. The unresolved problem is encrypting data-in-use. Currently, in order to process data, we need to decrypt, process, and re-encrypt. Computation over unencrypted data may compromise the confidentiality of data and suffer various security attacks\r\nPrivacy-Preserving Computing (PPC) has emerged in recent years to enable the secure computation of the data without revealing the content of the data. These techniques look at how to represent data in a form that can be shared, analyzed, and operated on without exposing the raw information\r\nWe will discuss current state-of-the-art PPC techniques and the distinct threat models and business use cases they address. The techniques we will cover are: Secure multiparty computation (SMPC), Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), Differential privacy (DP)",

            "description": "As software professionals, we can sometimes find inspiration in unexpected places, including the art world. In fact, testing, itself, is art as much as it is engineering. Ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock prints are well renowned for their supple beauty, intimate scenes, and vibrant colors. Prints like The Great Wave Off Kanagawa are cherished for their remarkable quality. Ukiyo-e masters like Hokusai and Hiroshige perfected their craft to produce masterpieces that are still cherished centuries later.\r\n\r\nWe can take cues from these prolific artists in how we approach quality in our own work. In this talk, we will cover eight auspicious ideas inspired by ukiyo-e printing that can advance excellence in the craft of software testing. These convictions include, among others: focusing on the value that consumers seek, picking the right tests based on risks, and optimizing development processes without sacrificing quality.\r\n\r\nCome learn how to develop a great testing strategy using all eight points. You will gain a blueprint for testing success that will help you create your own masterpieces, as well as a deep appreciation for the meaning of true quality.",

When tests fail -- and they will -- you quickly want to know why, without having to dig deep into the test code.\r\n\r\nAssertJ is a popular add-on library for JUnit tests, used by tiny to huge projects (like the Spring framework). This session will show you how easy it is to write more readable tests using its \"fluent\" syntax. You'll learn:\r\n\r\n* Patterns for writing good unit tests\r\n* How to express intent more clearly with methods for collections, such as \"containsExactly\" and \"containsOnlyOnce\"\r\n* Ways to check for exceptions, or ensure that no exceptions were thrown, but your code under test\r\n* How to customize assertions for your domain, such as for a Blackjack game with: assertThat(game.dealerHand()).holeCard().isFaceDown();\r\n* How to translate other assertion libraries to AssertJ",

            "description": "Talk about APIs and not talk about versioning, at the very least not mention the word “versioning” is impossible. APIs present a strange dichotomy. One one hand you have a product which helps software developers to integrate with. On the other hand, your product is also the entry point to data. Whilst bug fixing a product happens with versions, we have the contradiction with APIs where ensuring a proper versioning strategy is required to make sure that the API remains functional and most importantly the clients consuming your API remains functional.\r\n\r\nTalk about APIs and we have 3 very different API paradigms - Http APIs, gRPC and GraphQL. What are the basics of the three api paradigms and what do we need to know to come up with an API versioning strategy? Do we have any in-built support from the API paradigm itself? How can you be smart about API Versioning? Know answers to these questions in my session where I take you through the world of API versioning with code demos!",

Limited by the constraints of the 737’s original design and their desire to minimize training needed by pilots to fly the new aircraft, Boeing made multiple critical compromises in the aircraft’s design. 346 deaths and $87 billion later, we have all been reminded of the importance of rigorous design processes and the need to engineer systems for the realities of the end users and their environment. This talk dives into the motivations for the design compromises, the human factors considerations that were disregarded, and how a Fortune 100 company’s prioritization of profit over good design practice led to its stunning fall from grace. The lessons learned are directly applicable to all kinds of developers, from web designers to mission-critical infrastructure engineers.",

            "description": "ChatGPT has been all the rage since the late months of 2022. People are constantly asking if it’s a threat to certain peoples' jobs and if it isn't yet, when will it be? With v4 right around the corner, this will only increase dramatically. There are always disruptors in play, some big and some small and ChatGPT is certainly one of the big ones. Instead of fearing it, how can we embrace it and leverage it to help us do even better at our own software engineering related roles?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore very practical uses of ChatGPT within the every day work we do. Are you a software engineer? Cloud? QA? Data? No matter what type, ChatGPT can undoubtedly provide great lift. We will talk about what problems it is good at solving and what tasks it is good at executing. Opposite of that, we will also explore what ChatGPT isn't very good at and learn how to adapt our inputs to its weaknesses to get optimal results and not waste our time in the areas it does not yet excel.\r\n\r\nAs any type of engineer in the software space, you will walk away with several use cases that can help you do your job more efficiently and sometimes even better. These use cases will be the foundation in which you can discover even more uses through experimentation to help you be great at your role.",

While we may not be called upon to thwart direct enemy action, as meeting facilitators we should run the kinds of meetings we would want to attend. There are many reasons meetings are ineffective, most of which can only be mitigated before the meeting happens. This talk will give you things to consider and do to prepare for a meeting.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with some techniques they can use today to make the most of their precious time. This is primarily aimed at anyone running a meeting. Facilitators, scrum masters, team leads, and managers most often do this, but anyone attending a meeting could benefit. To misquote Arleen Lorrance, “be the meeting you want to see happen.”",

What if you could model your application into a finite number of states and test it in isolation, as if it were just another component in your application? In this talk, we'll explore modeling application state with XState while utilizing Storybook and React to treat it as if it were just another component that can be visually reviewed and understood by both the development and product teams, and can be tested independently of any UI code. By the end of this talk, you will have a baseline of what XState is and how it can be used within a React application, and you'll hear about how we did just that to manage some of the most complex pieces of our application.\r\n\r\n",

We'll examine the usage of offline optimistic locking, serializable transactions, and very carefully use offline pessimistic locking.  \r\nDoing a deep dive into Marten's asynchronous event projection processing, I'll show some strategies for parallelizing work through the producer/consumer pattern. We'll also examine how Marten parallelized work through data sharding, leader election, and work assignment throughout an application cluster. Just to make things harder, we'll also talk about the necessary instrumentation and error handling it's taken to keep all that parallel work synchronized in the face of intermittent errors.\r\n",

We often talk about the value of automated tests, production monitoring, and distributed tracing tools. But where should you invest? It's difficult to have a large suite of mature tools that give you what you need and while getting early feedback during development is critical, so is having a quick process for getting code out to users.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore where those investments should go for maximum effect. Not every tool can solve every problem, but a combination of them can sure give lots of confidence.",

There are many design features in the JVM and the JDK that are there to help keep your application safe from harm.  \r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll walk through these points - from compiler, to bytecode to runtime and give you a refresher on how to get the best from these features. We’ll also look at new things in the works, compile-to-native consequences and even some off-the-wall “it’s just an idea” thoughts about how to make the JVM an even more secure environment.  \r\n\r\n",

This talk will explore how the majority of cloud applications set themselves up for failure and what to do about it.\r\n\r\nOver 50 years ago in \"Goto Considered Harmful,\" Edgar Dijkstra warned us about the dangers of losing Execution Context. In response we changed the very foundations of programming by introducing core concepts and structures like function returns and formal control loops, which help us keep the context clear that we can’t imagine not having today. Others like Jules May have shown us far more recently the dangers of hidden coupling implicit in IF statements.\r\n\r\nHowever, each of these examples and warnings only consider single-threaded/local applications and code.\r\n\r\nJoin me as we examine the way these same fundamental challenges re-emerge on steroids in distributed and cloud-coding environments, and some new/old ideas that will let us re-chain the wolf.",

            "description": "People build software.  So, people problems can make or break the software. The Working Genius model, by Patrick Lencioni, gives a repeatable playbook to solving people problems in simple and profound ways. The Working Genius is an assessment and model that helps people discover their natural gifts and thrive in their work and life. When people are able to better understand the types of work that bring them more energy and fulfillment and avoid work that leads to frustration and failure, they can be more self-aware, more productive and more successful. When used with a team, it gives leaders a playbook to optimal functioning. This talk will cover the model and how to use it to solve people problems.",

That’s right; post-2020, this talk has been updated to include information on hybrid and remote learning.  Participants will leave ready to share their expertise with the world via more effective meetings, conference talks, workshops, and mentoring sessions… face-to-face, or camera-to-camera. \r\n",

We will debunk some myths, discuss how to get access to Azure Open AI, build out a low code/no code solution to leverage Azure Open AI, and finally build out our own version of an SMS-based search engine. After this talk, you will be able to build a system that allows you to send a text message to a number and have Open AI answer you wherever you have text message coverage for Free*. ",

            "description": "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is all around us, and we may interact with EDA-based systems daily without even knowing it. It is the architectural backbone of many retail banks, capital markets, e-commerce platforms, airlines, and large CPGs.  \r\n\r\nMany organizations are leaning towards cloud-based solutions to keep up with the high volume of data movement, to combat siloed application interactions and deployments, and to achieve the desired system scalability. However, many companies are faced with common challenges that come with a multi-cloud deployment of event-driven architecture systems. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Solace Developer Advocate Tamimi will give a high-level overview of event-driven architecture, review some real-world use cases, and delve into the importance of taking a cloud-agnostic approach to EDA. To wrap up, Tamimi will demonstrate how events can dynamically flow in a multi-cloud EDA solution that values cloud-agnostic data flow as a first-class citizen.  \r\n\r\nAttendees will leave this session with an understanding of: \r\n\r\n- What an advanced event broker is and how it makes up the central nervous system for real-time data movement. \r\n\r\n- Cloud-native solutions to EDA deployment and the vendor lock-in challenges associated with them. \r\n\r\n- The power of an event mesh, an architecture layer that allows events to flow freely between applications no matter where they are deployed (on-premise, private cloud, public cloud).

I'll talk about FAST, what it means to accessibility, and to users, developers, designers, and everyone in-between in the organization.\r\n\r\nI'll also introduce people to the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST) which advises creators of technical specifications on ensuring their technology meets the needs of users with disabilities. It primarily addresses web content technologies but also relates to any technology that affects web content sent to users, including client-side APIs, transmission protocols, and interchange formats. Specifications that implement these guidelines make it possible for content authors and user agents to render the content in an accessible manner to people with a wide range of abilities.",

Did you know that clouds are complex, chaotic systems that have a lot in common with our tech clouds of today? Weather systems and planetary atmospheres are fascinating explorations in understanding, modeling, and (attempting to) predict complex chaotic systems in an applied setting, and the human race has been studying clouds for millions of years. We’ve only started studying them from the perspective of mathematics and physics in recent times—a timeframe measured in hundreds of years. In comparison, the modern cloud-based computing world has only been around for a “short” time. There’s a lot we can learn from the world of meteorology and atmospheric science, so let’s go on a tour through our atmosphere and beyond, and see what we can learn about understanding, modeling, and predicting complex systems from these ephemeral masses of vapor.",

Don’t get me started on how weird the idea of NORMAL is…we’ll be here all day.\r\n\r\nBrains are weird, neat, squishy things. Mine has been diagnosed with conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and depression, with a list of common behaviors that go along with it. To some people, this might sound like terrible news. But, I have a different take on my particular collection of mental conditions. To me, they’re my Super Powers!\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the challenges that we face as testers, I want to present you with some examples of how neurodivergence can be harnessed to work for you - instead of against you. Come listen to stories of how these super powers help boost my curiosity, empathy, and effectiveness. You may just learn something about your own brain along  the way.\r\n\r\nSuper power examples I will share:\r\n- ADHD inspires in me a curiosity to dig below the surface \r\n- Anxiety helps me to empathize with user experience\r\n- Depression/manic cycles train me to use my energy wisely, at the right time",

But are you taking advantage of its full power? Do you stick with the Extract and Rename refactorings, because you're not sure how to use the more complicated ones?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll see how and when to use the many refactorings available to you. You'll learn about higher-level Refactoring Maneuvers, such as Cohere Method and Expose Details, and how they combine and sequence IntelliJ IDEA's automated refactorings to make your code more understandable and testable.\r\n\r\nThis session will cover:\r\n* Extract Method\r\n* Introduce Parameter\r\n* Move (Instance/Static) Method\r\n* Make Static\r\n* Inline Method\r\n* Introduce Constant\r\n* Extract Delegate (and Enum)\r\n* Introduce Field\r\n\r\nAlong the way you'll learn about a wealth of keyboard shortcuts to save your brain from having to think hard.",

In this session, we will look beyond the basics of gRPC. We will discuss the magic behind gRPC Protocol buffers in a bit more detail. We will then discuss the modes of gRPC and also how a gRPC service can be extended to be an HTTP API using gRPC JSON Transcoding. Finally, we will look into the concept of interceptors in gRPC.\r\n\r\nP.S. There will be lots of demos!",

The pool of experienced, senior-level engineers is shrinking rapidly, and sometimes even winning the salary bidding war isn't enough to acquire the skills your company needs to move product forward. The demand simply outweighs any institution's ability to produce hit-the-ground-running ready developers. If companies want to be successful in the future they need to start building the workforce they want to see. Creating a sustainable model that ensures your engineering teams will be able to scale to deliver your company's product must include growth strategies beyond just what you can hire. This talk will cover how to interview better, how to spot skill gaps in current team members, how to build sustainable mentoring processes that don't overburden the current team, and how to create a long-term growth environment.",

            "description": "React Native lets you build real native iOS and Android apps with a single JavaScript codebase while leveraging your experience building React web apps. That sounds great, but it's easy to get tripped up on early design decisions that seemingly portend a high switching cost later. Do you go with a \"managed\" app that handles native code for you (at the cost of flexibility), or do you buckle up for a \"bare\" experience that involves lots of debugging in Xcode? In other words, will it scale? We're happy to report that, YES, it will! Let's talk about what React Native is, how to get started with it in a new or existing app, and how what used to be major forks in the road are now incremental decisions that build on each other and can be added or removed easily as your app matures.",

Depending on your hosting model and how you do DevOps, requirements for scalability and availability you have tradeoffs that affect your long term costs and decision. In this session we look at how containerization has altered the landscape and to go from a monolith mindset to microservices requires more than wishful thinking or a management edict. As the cloud advances we need to understand the tradeoffs between compute options and make smart decisions on what makes the most sense to ensure you can get where you're going.",

Is there a way to build out applications that just work everywhere? Enter Electron. With Electron you can easily build out those cross-platform desktop apps with Vue, Vite and Vitest. You'll have access to native system API's such as the filesystem, network and user interfaces. All while building with the tech stack that we all know and love.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will be discussing what Electron is and why it's a great solution for building out desktop apps. We will go over how to add Electron to your project, the gotcha’s with working in a desktop environment and how to take your project to the next level by building a desktop application with Electron.

            "description": "Passwordless systems are fast becoming a reality as many of the big players (Microsoft, Google, Okta, AWS Cognito) implement support for FIDO2 and related technologies.\r\n\r\nAlthough developers are making great progress in using these technologies to implement new passwordless architectures for the users of their products, we are years behind in doing the same for our own internal infrastructure. Tokens, passwords, and other secrets that are shared internally among developers are a major security risk, yet are extremely common among companies of all sizes.\r\n\r\nThis talk gives an overview of the current situation and associated security risks, a review of FIDO and FIDO2 standards, the options we have to improve our designs, and a case study of a sample passwordless infrastructure stack. We'll also discuss things to look for and avoid when selecting vendors and development tools to greatly improve security posture.\r\n\r\nLearn how your team, regardless of size, can put all of the pieces together to implement a more secure, passwordless infrastructure.

It uses a number of new features in C# 9, 10 and 11 and the .NET framework to drastically reduces the code you need to define and start your app. It has been named Minimal Web APIs, but there is much more to it than just that. Time for us to take a look and discover what it is all about. During this session you will see the new ASP.NET Core approach, and learn how you can leverage this in your new applications from .NET 6 onwards. You will learn how to use dependency injection, new attributes, custom binding and changes in integration testing. Join me in this session to maximize your knowledge on minimal APIs.",

Or worse, did a software system confront you with a bad experience in the past?\r\nPictures are a strong tool in a software system that can trigger a lot of emotions. So in this talk we are  definitely going to look into picture and images.\r\nIf your software system is a to-do app, calendar or meeting system are you aware of popups, reminders, attention and attention loss? Are you aware that attentions and colors can trigger anxiety, stress or worse?\r\nAnd last but not least: Do you add that little extra functionality that creates the WOW moment for your user? Are you creating magic in their life?\r\nToday you will learn about triggering emotions with digital systems, and at least you know which emotions you can (unintentionally) trigger.",

            "description": "I have heard “you must be in the cloud if you want to do business in today’s world.” While I concur with the general gist of the concept, I question the most used migration methods, the concept everything must be cloud, and the focus on differentiation between on premise and cloud options. When a person only has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. This session focuses on getting away from the single tool approach by exposing you to additional tools.\r\n\r\nThis session is centered around the idea of understanding your current situation, assessing the steps you take, and determining your ideal endpoint, as well as steps you can take along the journey. Whether you are early in cloud adoption, already in process, or fairly mature in cloud residency, you will find some practical steps to help you on your journey. \r\n\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n•\tThe 6 Rs: Assessing Your Portfolio\r\n•\tStrategies for moving to the cloud\r\n•\tChoosing Between Various Cloud Options\r\n•\tCurrent Trends In Cloud Adoption\r\n•\tA Peek at the Future of Cloud\r\n•\tPractical Steps for Containing Cloud Costs\r\n",

While open source modules are undoubtedly awesome, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You’re introducing someone else’s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Including the wrong package can introduce severe vulnerabilities, exposing your application and your user’s data.\r\n\r\nWe’ll look at examples in the wild that have been exposed, some more famously than others, before showing you how to guard against these important security issues.",

            "description": "Testing is a vibrant discipline with well-established practices, but many times, nobody but the testers who write the tests ever see them. Tests could offer so much value if they were openly shared—with developers, product owners, and perhaps even end-users. So, why don’t we open our tests like we open our source? There are so many parallel benefits: helping others learn, helping teams develop higher-quality software, and helping users gain confidence in the products they use. Opening tests includes sharing the tools, frameworks, and even test cases themselves. With AI and ML technologies, we could even build a future where generic open tests for common behaviors could run on any kind of app. In this talk, we will look at ways a team could be more open about testing. Not every team may be able to publicly publish their tests, but any team could still benefit from the openings that shift-left practices can bring. Open Testing could be revolutionary. Let’s make it a reality!",

            "description": "Artificial intelligence is a powerful technology that is revolutionizing our lives, our work, and our world. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Unfortunately, most of us are not yet prepared to use our new AI superpowers ethically.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will explore the ethical implications of AI in a three-part journey through AI technologies of today, tomorrow, and the future. Along the way, we'll discuss potential problems and solutions to these new AI-created ethical dilemmas.\r\n\r\nWe'll begin with the ethical issues we face with today's AI, such as bias, lack of transparency, and surveillance capitalism. Next, we'll discuss the challenges of the next decade, including AI's impact on our labor economy, synthetic media, and human autonomy. Finally, we'll explore possibilities for the next century of AI, including artificial super intelligence, the value alignment problem, and the future of humanity.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we delve into the ethics of artificial intelligence and explore the potential challenges and benefits of this rapidly evolving technology. If you're a software developer, IT professional, or just curious about AI, you won't want to miss this thought-provoking exploration of the ethics of AI!",

            "description": "It has been said that data is the new currency. The more your company relies on data the more you need to understand data patterns for handling how data comes into your systems, managed, stored, and represented. We are no longer in the world of \"just use a single\" database. We now need to choose the right data management and storage tools based on business objectives. This means understanding more than a relational database like SQL Server or Oracle. It means understanding what database option is best based on business processes. It also means understanding patterns that can be applied to data that allow for better data analysis, and cost effective storage.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss data patterns that can be applied at the application level as well as database. Are you processing and storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or perhaps credit card information (PCI-DSS)?  You'll also see data protection options for data in-transit and at rest. We'll also discuss patterns for keeping a history of changes with Event Sourcing. You'll also learn about the CQRS pattern used to keep the demand for retrieving data from impacting the ability of receiving new data.",

We use infrastructure like Azure Service Bus or Service Fabric. Maybe we’ll introduce patterns like CQRS and Event Sourcing. Many of these choices introduce eventual consistency, but users expect immediate consistency. They don’t want to wait for eventually. They expect feedback now. There are, however, ways to work around this.\r\n\r\nSo what exactly is eventual consistency and how can we make it work? In this session, we’ll have a look at different patterns, both in the user interface and the back end, that give our users immediate feedback even though the back-end system is not. We’ll discuss how to solve the complexity of dealing with eventual consistency, without sacrificing decomposability or performance.",

            "description": "Troubleshooting is a critical aspect of any DevOps workflow, and it can often feel like navigating a complex, unknown landscape. In many ways, troubleshooting in DevOps is similar to exploring a map in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) without a tutorial. Both require a deep understanding of the systems and processes at play, a clear and efficient method of communication among team members, the ability to adapt to unexpected challenges, and rapidly learn/experiment with the system in a safe controlled way.\r\n\r\nThis session will discuss Sean’s experience at Progress Chef learning complex build systems, running on a hybrid infrastructure including modern and esoteric systems, not to mention the legacy/heritage code, decisions, and designs while keeping the lights on. \r\n\r\nThrough Sean’s experience, we will discuss approaches you can use to improve your understanding of the system, reduce end-user frustrations, experiment without breaking, and better support development workflows.\r\n\r\nJoin us while we have a fun conversation about real-world examples of troubleshooting crazy complex systems and how you can apply those technics to your DevOps process.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint presentation with Sean Simmons, a Principal DevOps Engineer at Progress Chef and George Westwater, Senior Director of Engineering at Progress Chef.",

Engaging documentation focuses on what your users want to do, the tasks they're trying to accomplish, the problems they want to solve. Writing documentation with the focus on your user, instead of the product, results in a better experience for the user and a better reputation for your product. \r\n\r\nFinding the right balance isn't always easy, though. In this session, you'll discover the right verbs that fit the use cases for your product. That means learning more about your users and what they want, which may be more than one group of people. You'll turn those use cases into effective tutorials that cover the right amount of information. And you'll learn when reference-style documentation is needed, and how to make that more efficient too.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn:\r\n* How to shift the focus from what the product is to what the reader wants to do.\r\n* Discovering the verbs that relate to your product.\r\n* How to create tutorial scenarios for your use cases.\r\n* How to write effective documentation for users with different experience levels.\r\n* When reference-style documentation is appropriate.",

Configure your workspace with Angular ESLint's accessibility rules to get feedback directly in the template code and fix issues early in development. Write unit tests with Angular Testing Library that interact with applications the same way a user would, including users of assistive devices. Verify the accessibility of fully running applications in Cypress end-to-end tests that use cypress-axe to run an extensive series of automated tests with the underlying axe-core accessibility testing engine. Automate checks at each stage of development and release by incorporating these tools into your development process and continuous integration pipeline to ensure your Angular applications are more accessible to all users.",

I'd like to free up more of his time and energy for snuggling and play but the outdoors must still be monitored. Thankfully, it turns out that much of what my dog does, Azure Cognitive Services can help with.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll use this absurd premise to explore progressively enhancing applications through the Azure Cognitive Services speech, vision, and text APIs. We'll look at object detection, facial APIs, text to speech, speech to text, and language understanding.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session you'll have more of an understanding of what Azure Cognitive Services can do and the basics of how to interact with them from code so that you, like my dog, can take advantage of pre-trained machine learning models to enhance devote more of your energy to other areas.",

            "description": "As a web developer, I have spent most of my career struggling with UX. While libraries like SASS and Bootstrap have made CSS easier, it can still be a nightmare to get that picture in your head onto the screen the way you want it. But what about that picture in your head? What is a “good” color palette? How should my page elements be spaced out? And what about all these font faces and sizes? And once you’ve figured that all out, you need to worry about things like responsiveness and accessibility. If you’re working on a team, how do you ensure everyone is on the same page (no pun intended) with the look and feel of the site? It can all seem overwhelming. And you end up feeling like you spend more time messing with the “look” of your web page than you do working on the functionality of your application.\r\n\r\nAs a design-challenged web developer, I have been there. I have felt this pain. The good news is that there is a solution. In this session, I’ll show you how I used Tailwind CSS, a little design knowledge, and a small upfront investment in time to create a design language for my applications. This language is easy to use, can be tailored for different projects/clients, and helps keep a consistent look and feel across your application. Let’s finally tame the “design monster” and get back to coding!",

Don’t worry; I’m here to help and give you the tools to help wrangle your clusters so you can focus on building for the business instead of fighting infrastructure. Leveraging GitOps and the principles around a mash-up of traditional infrastructure management and software development practices creates an auditable/accountable/enforceable way to interface with your fleet.\r\nIn this talk, I’ll be walking through (a strong possibility of your situation) why GitOps has become the de facto way to maintain your cluster(s), advantages and struggles going down this path, and strong suggestions on “fastest time to dopamine” paths. You should know that you can take bits and pieces from this talk and build this up piecemeal, but the sooner you leverage this, the sooner you can start focusing on what makes your business win instead of losing time with administration.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\nIntroduction\r\nWhat is GitOps?\r\nWhy should you care?\r\nA git typical workflow\r\nOptions for different ways of making this happen\r\nDemo the infrastructure management \r\nDemo for a simple application \r\nConclusion and where to go",

However, as we move forward in our craft, it is crucial that we address the elephant in the room (or in the dataset): bias. Bias crops up everywhere, from the unconscious biases that exist in society- to those that can be introduced in datasets and algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis session is meant to encourage participants to consider their own biases (and the impact they may have on machine learning models), and to provide the tools needed to create more fair and just systems. We will begin with an interactive and human-focused discourse about bias: what it is, the forms it appears in, and how it permeates our society. Then we'll explore different types of bias within the context of machine learning, such as overfitting bias, algorithmic bias, and prejudice bias, using real-world stories and examples. Together we will examine the consequences of bias left unattended, including the potential for discrimination and unfair decision-making.\r\n\r\nWe will delve into the latest research and several approaches to mitigating bias, including data preprocessing, fair representation learning, and bias correction algorithms. We will also work through one example together to give participants a hands-on understanding of how to apply these techniques in practice. By understanding bias and taking the steps necessary to quell its effects, we can ensure that machine learning is used responsibly and ethically in the future, resulting in a world with more trustworthy technology.

            "description": "Many developers would love to work on brand-new, cutting-edge, greenfield projects, never dealing with the mess of unintelligible code someone else left behind. But most of us spend most of our time maintaining existing code, and it is often spaghetti code with no unit tests, no documentation, and, if we are lucky, a comment that says, “Not sure how this works, but it does so don’t touch it.” We need to make changes, but we can’t even figure out what the code is supposed to do. You know your changes will pile on and make it worse. You can’t change the code safely without adding tests, but you can’t add tests without making changes. So how do you tackle this chicken-and-egg problem? You do it slowly and methodically, building a safety net along the way. \r\nJoin Gene as he talks about helping to maintain and improve code on an infamous software project- it was so bad it made the national news. He’ll explain his approach to breaking the code into manageable, maintainable chunks. He’ll talk about adding unit tests that actually test the code using mutation testing- one of his favorite subjects. If you have inherited a pile of code and want to clean it up into something you aren’t afraid to touch, this talk is for you. You’ll hear about some tools and approaches to help you turn legacy code into code you don’t hate.\r\n",

Utilizing the power of the Pull Request initiated pipeline, this workflow uses cookstyle, test kitchen, and peer approval as guard rails to verify newly developed Chef code. Leveraging the policyfile model, this workflow uses version pinning and policy groups to determine what code is applied to each managed node. Verified code is automatically delivered to a given policy group allowing for code delivery at multiple environment levels (test, stage, dev, prod) resulting in live testing in lower environments immediately after PR approval.

Parents, so numb to the question as to consider it rhetorical, do not bother to answer with their inevitable “Yes.”\r\n\r\nBut why?\r\n\r\nKids are naturally attracted to the newest, flashiest games, the streaming videos their friends are giggling at, the morning news telling viewers to learn to code for a great job someday interspersed with advertisements for the fastest internet; the best tech-driven healthcare; the greatest possible life available along the single path of technology.\r\n \r\nTechnology, however, has a foundation.  Reading, writing, mathematics, history, culture studies, music, art.  Without these, technology loses context (read “value”) and people lose focus.\r\n\r\nChildren need to learn widely, gain the skills and knowledge that may, one day, underpin truly value-adding technology whether that be really cool games and movies, or apps and artificial intelligence.  For this same reason, adults are not exempt from the need for a broad spectrum of knowledge.  It is the quality of one’s ideas and their ability to put those ideas into the written word that most heavily influence future success.  \r\n\r\nJoin this mother daughter duo as they dive into why it is important to know more than just technology.

Most mobile apps are not designed with accessibility for diverse disabilities in mind. Accessible visual design and user-friendly interfaces are easily implemented and can increase your userbase exponentially with the right knowledge. Disabilities can be broken down into four categories: visual impairment, hard of hearing, physical/motor and neurological. We’ll explore how to create accessibility in each of these categories.",

From stakeholders who don't understand the development process leading to unreasonable deadlines, to scrum masters who fold under the pressure of these stakeholders. If you've been a developer for a while, you've definitely experienced this. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll go over some practical steps to help advocate for yourself as an engineer and prevent burnout from a toxic Agile environment:\r\n\r\n1. Establish healthy expectations about deadlines, quality, and requirements right away.\r\n\r\n2. Encourage open communication within the scrum team so that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities, as well as each other's workloads and capacity\r\n\r\n3. Familiarize yourself with the Agile manifesto and hold your team accountable. \r\n\r\n4. Take time off.\r\n\r\n5. Keep track of software changes and completed tasks to support accurate documentation and faster debugging when issues arise.",

Static analysis tools scrutinize your code as you write it - giving you blazing fast feedback at development time. We’re going to go into how that works, why it’s useful, and -best of all- how to enable the best configurations for ESLint, TypeScript, and their associated tooling in your app. \r\nIn particular, we'll cover:\r\n\r\n* The tooling differences between formatters, linters, and type checkers\r\n* How to appropriately set up each of those tools for local development and CI/builds\r\n* The kinds of development-time issues each of those tools catch\r\n* The deep configuration rabbit holes one can joyously fall into when setting up ESLint plugins\r\n* Using ESLint and TypeScript as documentation sources and to educate developers on general and team-specific best practices\r\n\r\nThis talk will have you detecting bugs, bad practices, and code smells at lightning speed! ⚡️\r\n",

            "description": "Developers are not security experts! I’ve heard this exclamation time and again and I wonder, why not? And should they be?\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that software teams must work to address a number of security concerns today. But we’re still learning and actively developing best practices. We’re still figuring out — sometimes through trial and error — the best way to tackle security issues that won’t negatively interfere with delivering functional (and secure) software.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to developers securing software, there is only a subset of prevention and mitigation strategies that make sense to put on a developer’s plate. Even then, an expectation that all developers by default are equipped to handle this additional workload is unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThis session is targeted toward developers and anyone wanting to improve or prevent circumstances that send many devs hurtling toward burnout. I will include explanations of security related terms and lingo that are streaming into our development environments; share typical places a developer needs to look to shore up applications including dependencies, packaging, and supply chain concerns; and discuss the plethora of scanning tools available to developers today and how they work. You will learn how to integrate a measure of security that makes sense into your already existing development processes and how to introduce a security culture to your development team in a healthy way. Leave with a better understanding of application security needed from a developer’s perspective, some stats to plead your case if needed, and a sense of empowerment.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, don’t lose heart! We’re getting better and better at this and the future looks bright!",

The talk explores how concepts of ensemble, pas de deux, choreography, grand jeté, adagio, and tutu can be used to explain different aspects of distributed computing. The speaker draws parallels between the precision and coordination required of ballet dancers and the precision and coordination required of devices working together in distributed computing. By using relatable and engaging metaphors, the speaker breaks down complex computing concepts and makes them more accessible to a broader audience. ",

Data breaches at some of the biggest organizations in the world caused by stolen passwords continue to make headlines. As long as an authentication method involves secrets (passwords) that are transmitted to, or stored on a database or server somewhere, they can be intercepted and stolen by attackers.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could eliminate shared secrets (aka passwords)? We would thwart all phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore the potential of public-key cryptography to provide secure, passwordless authentication methods that don't require sharing or transmitting sensitive credentials. We'll explore the current landscape of non-password authentication technologies like WebAuthn and passkeys, and delve into the technical details of how they work and what you need to do to start using them. We’ll also discuss the challenges and opportunities for wider adoption. In the end, you’ll walk away with the hope of a more secure future.\r\n",

Configuring Maven is deceptively simple, after all it's just a matter of writing XML, isn't it? Things look differently when the rubber meets the road. One must know the intricacies of the build lifecycle; how plugins, goals (mojos), and phases come together; rules for dependency resolution; configuration inheritance between parent - child POM files; enhancing the build with profiles; and more. These features may trip you over if the rules that govern them are unclear. We'll present a series of scenarios to test your knowledge on Maven rules. we guarantee you'll leave this session with a few bits of new information and better understanding of the Maven build tool.",

One of the key ways we can communicate the intentions of our software is through software designs. In this talk, we'll walk through the various parts of an effective software design; we'll discuss what requirements are, and how requirements differ from constraints and assumptions; we'll describe how to identify and call out design decisions and alternatives; and we'll describe what an architecture is and how it differs from a design. Along the way, we'll also talk about the 'geometry' of software development, what the meaning of the word \"undefined behavior\" really is, and we'll live-code a design document from a real use case.",

The challenge increases when you have to work with multiple teams that themselves are growing with new members and changing objectives while remote as you are trying to get a handle on everything with them and your own project scope.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on how to get a firm footing in a remote and hybrid team and develop the best ways to work with everyone to define objectives and move forward on project delivery. Learn how to use the best tools to connect with distributed teams, define mutual project goals, set long term objectives, and keep communication in a shared loop. With these key concepts built from lessons learned in working with distributed teams you will see that herding cats can get a little better with the right tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\nHow to use the big company-goals of your organization to drive shared outcomes with everyone\r\nMaking introductions and connections to connect your team using Remote communication\r\nHow to provide guidance to your team with simple resources like schedules, roadmaps and flowcharts\r\nDeveloping your Project plan with OKRs and updates for continuous improvement along the way\r\n",

What about accessing a device's battery status, orientation, accelerometer, and gyroscope? Or connecting to a Bluetooth device. How about pulling data from an external device via a Serial or WebUSB? Are you aware of the Fullscreen  or the GamePad API? Have an e-commerce app or an app that processes microtransactions? Does it use the PaymentRequest API? There are tons of really cool APIs that you might not be aware of. Or maybe you are aware of them, but you're just not sure how to use them to improve your application? In this session, I'll introduce you to some of the lesser known APIs that are available in most modern web browsers. I'll also show you some demos that I've created with these APIs to show you how they can actually be used to make engaging experiences that keep your users happy and keep them coming back to your site.

Is that even a good idea?\r\n\r\nRecent releases of .NET include an exciting new option for hosting web applications: Minimal APIs, which provide a lightweight request-to-response handling framework in the vein of Express.js or Ruby's Sinatra. The announcement came with lean and mean examples which are exciting, but leave something to be desired when it comes to imagining a real-world application.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will pick up where the tutorial drops off to see how an actual application takes shape using this new framework. We'll see what patterns develop as we add more endpoints than fit on one screen, and how to implement necessary components such as security, documentation and API versioning without losing the desired slim profile.\r\n\r\nMy team selected Minimal APIs for a small-but-growing application last summer. It turned out to be a good fit, but jumping the hurdles and smoothing the rough edges revealed where and how it wouldn't be. I come to you now with tips and tricks to make your experience with the framework better, and to inform you when (and when not) a similar choice is the right move.",

There are many platforms to deploy your .NET 7 apps, and most developers do not understand these other clouds' benefits, including elasticity, scalability, and flexibility. This talk introduces the AWS tools and services directly suited for .NET development and deployment. It is a starting point for .NET architects and developers who wish to develop, build, deploy and maintain their applications on AWS. Attendees will learn the approaches that can be used to deploy .NET applications on AWS and detail the options and services that can help developers get the most business value from their cloud-based solutions.",

Or why would you ask your developers to understand the internals of PyTorch framework?\r\n\r\nThis talk tells a story about how a financial institution built a Machine Learning platform that allowed data scientists to carry out ML tasks without needing to know Kubernetes. App developers were able to consume models without going into ML framework complexities.\r\nBuilding platforms on top of Kubernetes is hard as many components are glued together for specific use cases. \r\n\r\nA successful platform uses the right abstractions to meet varying needs of users. A demo using Kubeflow, kfserving, ArgoCD, Crossplane, Dapr and Knative will highlight lessons learnt while building such a platform with suggestions on how to avoid pitfalls. You will also see a glimpse of struggles faced by data scientists in cloud native hyperspace. ",

User research, user testing, user feedback – the end user is at the heart of everything that we build. However, for many companies, making conversations with real users actually happen is a real challenge – especially if you don't have a UX specialist on your team! If this is all sounding familiar to you, then I have a recommendation: take it into your own hands. In this session, we'll talk through setting up a basic user testing program and growing it, so you – the developer – can feel empowered to start usability testing for your own product! ",

            "description": "Have you ever trained a machine learning model with amazing accuracy, only to deploy it into production and have it not perform as well? Data leakage may be the culprit! Data leakage occurs when your machine learning model has accidentally learned information about the test set. It can unfortunately be introduced in many different scenarios and can have a huge impact on your model's performance in production.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll cover the different types of data leakage that exist and share best practices for preventing data leakage.",

As QA leaders, if you only focus on UI automation, it might bring some peace of mind, but you’re missing out on everything under the surface of your products. \r\n\r\nAs an avid fan of API testing and Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), I will take attendees on a quest to gain new insights into attacking test plans and practical solutions to avoid the front-end/back-end blame game. In addition, we will explore how leveraging D&D concepts can help you overcome your own API implementation roadblocks. Everyone deserves a holistic testing strategy that meets your business logic, while increasing coverage for all, and that includes those stuck only testing the UI. \r\n\r\nWhen you set out to slay the dragon it’s a good idea to use more than one approach, and the same is true for testing your products. So grab those dice and join the battle for API testing.  ",

            "description": "Do you know how your data moves into and out of your Apache Kafka® instance? From the programmer’s point of view, it’s relatively simple. But under the hood, writing to and reading from Kafka is a complex process with a fascinating life cycle that’s worth understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen you call producer.send() or consumer.poll(), those calls are translated into low-level requests which are sent along to the brokers for processing. In this session, we’ll dive into the world of Kafka producers and consumers to follow a request from an initial call to send() or poll(), all the way to disk, and back to the client via the broker’s final response. Along the way, we’ll explore a number of client and broker configurations that affect how these requests are handled and discuss the metrics that you can monitor to help you to keep track of every stage of the request life cycle.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you’ll know the ins and outs of the read and write requests that your Kafka clients make, making your next debugging or performance analysis session a breeze.

Who publishes, who subscribes? What do the fields on the message mean?\r\n- How do you gain an understanding of the flows of messages in your system for choreography?\r\n- How do you manage the infrastructure associated with events such as topics, queues, access controls?\r\n- How do you manage the versioning of events and ensure you do not break consumers?\r\n\r\nIn this session we will examine these questions and more. We will look at the use of emerging standards such as AsyncAPI and CloudEvents to document our event based APIs,  how they can help us generate code to manage the required infrastructure, how they can help us to understand the flow of events within our systems and how they can help us scaffold new applications. We will demo an end-to-end usage of AsyncAPI to define our APIs, scaffold the code required, and deploy the necessary infrastructure to run. ",

There are battle-tested standards, interesting edge cases, and security risks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you’ll learn about common authentication patterns building on standards like OIDC, JWT and SAML.These patterns are drawn from hundreds of customer implementations.  Examples of patterns such as the backend-for-frontend and identity broker will be diagrammed and dissected. You’ll also learn when to apply these patterns and what gotchas to watch out for.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you’ll be able to map identity problems into common architectural patterns and solutions.\r\n\r\n",

Bounce from meeting to meeting? Maybe people just don't understand the full cost of context switching.  Through activities and discussions I'll work to convince any doubters that multi-tasking is evil, but also explore tangible approaches to avoid it.",

Whether you're interested in creating a language as a hobby, solve a problem at work with a DSL, contribute to an existing language, or even if you just want to better understand the compilers and interpreters you already use, this session is for you. We'll cover programming language fundamentals like Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and expressions, the ANTLR parser/lexer generator, a plan for how you can create a language from scratch, and add a feature to a language in a demo. Example parser code will be in C#/.NET but the concepts are applicable to all languages. While this is an introduction to creating languages, it does assume that you have used programming languages enough that you would understand the purpose of creating one, and thus is considered an Intermediate-level session.",

It’s time to modernize, but that doesn’t mean rewrite.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll walk through migrating a typical enterprise .NET 4.8 web app from soup to nuts. We’ll look at tools and techniques for migrating features and components incrementally (and still deploying to production). I’ll also highlight some of the newer analyzers to see what we can easily migrate, adapt, or replace. We’ll look at many of the common dependencies and components most systems incorporate, such as Entity Framework, SignalR, and DI containers, and how to modernize and migrate those components. There may even be Web Forms!\r\n\r\nMigrating to modern frameworks can seem daunting, but luckily for us, we can do so in a safe, deliberate approach that I will walk through in a real-world example.",

            "description": "Traditionally, products and services are focused on various functional and non-functional requirements (things the system should be or do). While this is important, there has been a lack of focus on emotional requirements (feelings that the system should induce in its users). Why is this important?\r\n\r\nBecause the way we feel is important and should be considered!\r\n\r\nA bold claim? Perhaps. And, as with any claim, it should be supported with evidence.  In this talk, I stress the importance of emotional requirements and support the claim by providing relevant facts, opinions, statistics, quotations, examples, hypotheticals, and more.  Once I’ve sufficiently supported the claim, I offer a few practical methods by which to gather, induce, and test emotional requirements. Finally, I use placebos as lens to view systems and gain insight into emotional requirements.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a thoughtful and thorough exploration of The Hidden Requirements!",

With AI based semantic search abilities this technology can provide results that are closer to the intent of original query. \r\n\r\nYou will also learn how to enhance and enrich search through Cognitive Service Skills like natural language processing, image analysis, entity recognition capabilities. Don't know what those are? Well that's not a problem because you will find out.\r\n\r\nYou can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes. Why not use the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that Bing and Office have used for more than a decade into your site? Maybe AI can make it \"just\" work.",

            "description": "Mental models like the testing pyramid and testing trophy provide good high level ideas about different categories of automated testing - unit, integration, end-to-end. They help us understand the tradeoffs between them and the value of each.\r\n\r\nIn real life, sometimes testing feels a lot less organized than that. Instead of a pyramid, it's more like sea monster, trying to pull our ship down with its many weird tentacles. Not only that, it's doing this when we are focused on getting our ship from A to B. We don't want to be fighting off this sea monster, we want to be delivering quality software. We only want to think about testing in the context of how it helps us deliver quality software quickly, and with confidence.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll focus on front-end testing and a decision framework to help us \"test what matters, where it matters\" and outsmart the sea monster. We will use Cypress to show examples of end-to-end, component, unit, and API level tests and see how they work together.",

Are you spending time diagnosing issues in your distributed systems without a good understanding of how your microservices are built? As system complexity increases, the ability to understand the sum of the outputs becomes more and more difficult and the volume of data about your services becomes overwhelming. Luckily, having an observability mindset when instrumenting your outputs and leveraging the right tool for your team can help you cut through the noise and identify key offenders in your system and resolve them quickly and efficiently. In this talk, we will discuss the differences between traditional performance monitoring and observability and how to understand how they can independently and together ensure the health of your team and keep your end users (and your developers!) happy and focused on the right things.",

As architects though, we must consider the trade offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone finds on the inner webs?\r\n\r\nAs architects it is our responsibility to effectively guide our teams on the technology journey. In this talk I will outline the importance of trade offs, how we can analyze new technologies and how we can effectively capture the inevitable architectural decisions we will make. I will also explore the value of fitness functions as a way of ensuring the decisions we make are actually reflected in the code base.",

And not just for yourself, but every one. The developers, the database admin, the operations team - none of them should have access to production. \r\n\r\nSo how can we do that, and at the same time maintain our high rate of releases, our agility and our sanity?\r\n\r\nGlenn will go though some principles to follow and also show you  in practice how you can create your environment, lock it down and update it, all without human intervention. He will also show you how you can monitor the environment for unauthorized changes. How you can have \"emergency hatches\" for when you really need access, but in a controlled fashion. Examples will be for Microsoft Azure, but the principles are universal.  \r\n\r\nIn short, if you want to keep your production environment and production data at an arms length, but still so what you need when you need it, this is your session.

            "description": "Terraform has become vital to your team's workflow for managing your infrastructure. However, as your infrastructure has grown your code has become more complex, needlessly messy, and harder to manage.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore ways to simplify your infrastructure code even while you add more resources to your infrastructure. We'll dive into advanced features in Terraform such as modules, workspaces, for_loops, and data sources to build reusable, scalable infrastructure. By the end of this talk, you will be able to recognize these features, know when to use them, and how to implement them to scale your Terraform code in a clean, reliable, and efficient way.﻿",

Of the dozens of new features added to JavaScript over the last ten years, Promises stand out as one of the most important yet most difficult to understand for both backend and frontend developers. If you're looking to finally understand the 'what', 'why', and 'how' of Promises, this is your ELI5 (\"explain like I'm five\") moment.\r\n\r\nLet's learn about asynchronous programming in JavaScript by understanding the fundamentals of Promises: why they were added to the language, what you need to write your own, how async/await fix Promise chaining, recent API changes, and much more. This session will introduce the basics of Promises, then ramp up into practical examples and techniques that will help you fully utilize Promises in your code today.",

Electron is the battle-tested way of bringing web apps, including Blazor, to desktop land, complete with deep OS integrations.\r\n\r\n.NET MAUI, the next generation of .NET cross-platform strategy, changes the game for Blazor. With a modern abstracted cross-platform WebView, Blazor UI can be rendered across mobile/desktop apps with lighter footprint, while sharing components, routes & styles from web world. Armed with full platform API access from .NET MAUI, Blazor can also pull off some very native features on mobile & desktop. JS Interop works too.\r\n\r\nBlazor is very welcome on desktop apps – the how depends on app needs. The familiarity of Blazor component model, Razor rendering engine, CSS styling & UI extensibility can now be applied towards building desktop apps, all the while sharing code with web. You game?\r\n",

            "description": "Most organizations are subject to the rules of an ever-increasing number of regulations, while dealing with rapidly escalating endpoints and environments to test. No matter the time and resources applied to an external assessment or audit, manual processes cannot keep pace with cloud scale and growing technical complexity of modern environments.  This creates distractions for technical teams and contributes to delivery inefficiencies (reduced velocity) while also increasing the risk of “non-compliance” (adverse audit findings).\r\nA “continuous compliance” approach, empowered by modern DevOps automation approaches can help teams more efficiently handle the complex web of regulatory requirements and maintain their velocity.  This session will explore real world solutions to help you and your organization realize these benefits, including:\r\n\t· Managing the library of regulatory, security, and other key control points as code \r\n\t· Detecting non-compliance with policies and regulatory requirements continuously and in real time\r\n\t· Prioritizing issues for remediation across the entire fleet to help optimize engineering resource utilization\r\n\t· Automating the presentation of audit evidence to provide results at any time and with minimal effort\r\n \r\nIn addition to a discussion of these concepts and approaches, this session will also provide an exclusive demonstration of compliance automation for the recently-released PCI DSS V4.0 security standard, utilizing Chef Compliance to embed compliance into the software pipeline.  \r\n",

With improvements to observability and deployment tooling, can testing in production be a valid aspect of your quality strategy? This session evaluates the current testing ecosystem for pre- and post-deployment, including how to leverage deployment strategies to evaluate the quality of your codebase across the entire software development lifecycle — yes, even production.

            "description": "In a world of ever increasing regulations and concerns about data privacy, as data vault practitioners, it's important for us to understand how private data can be stored, managed and accessed.  The Business wants to feel confident that data is secure and that plans are in place all the way from ingestion to the presentation layer to keep access restricted by their ever changing policies and procedures.  Implementing a data vault on Snowflake allows access to features that facilitate this.  Using tag based dynamic policies for both row and column level data can provide robust privacy solutions.  These solutions do require an understanding of performance implications so we will also discuss the testing we’ve done on Snowflake and how these features perform as data sets increase in size and complexity.  Privacy also comes from data modeling as well and we’ll dive into some of the different ways to model as well as the pros and cons to each method.  Lastly, we’ll show how Snowflake’s automatic classification functions can partner with an existing automation tool to incorporate secure field detection within the modeling step and streamline the process to get business approval.",

Most developers have become distributed systems engineers, though not all of us recognize it yet. Attempting to address the inherent challenges of distributed systems, we often write code to deal with failures, timeouts, and retries, which distracts us from the core business logic and results in systems that are more complex and difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, Tom will explain some of the challenges that developers face when building distributed systems, typical ways that developers attempt to solve them, and how an open source software platform called Temporal helps developers build more scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications. \r\n",

            "description": "Starting a project can be a bit daunting but with the right tools you can begin with confidence that you will hit the right target. The problem is our conventional methods of planning are usually focused on text which may not resonate with people trying to get a sense of what they will be getting into. Most people are visual learners who absorb information from visual aides (diagrams, images, compositions, charts) which helps us map that content in our minds. Everyone can benefit from seeing the ‘grand vision’ as a starting point for product launches. \r\n\r\nThat’s where a visual tool like a Roadmap comes in handy. A Roadmap is a great way to showcase plans, goals and resonate with your team what the big milestones are. Beyond just a simple chart or diagram they can be useful as communication documents to align all stakeholders and get ready to dive into the details. Learn what is possible with using an illustrative Roadmap to tell a story and inform your team on all the critical details in an intuitive and fun way.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\nLearn how the essentials of creating a succinct Roadmap visual for your project kick-off\r\nExplain the challenges in a clear diagram format and use it get feedback from your team of how to address those issues\r\nUnderstand the basics of crafting a narrative to guide the audience through your Roadmap from the setting, key events and trajectory you will follow to the goal\r\nSee the possible tools for creating roadmaps and charts with software like Figma, Adobe Illustrator and even PowerPoint\r\n",

That may be because one of the least understood Agile values is \"Working software over comprehensive documentation\". \r\n\r\nBoth teams and leaders are constantly distracted by the tangible, yet limited value, outputs because they are easier to measure, provide a false sense of progress, and are more fully within their control. Come find out why outputs suck people in, how to shift focus to outcomes, and many of the small obstacles that get in the way. Outcomes refer to the impact or result of a particular action or effort, whereas outputs refer to the tangible products or services that are produced as a result of that action or effort. Outcomes are considered to be more important because they measure the effectiveness of the action or effort in achieving the desired result, whereas outputs simply measure the quantity or quality of the products or services produced. In other words, outcomes are a measure of success, while outputs are a measure of activity.",

            "description": "The world is moving at an unprecedented pace and much of it has been powered by the innovations in software and systems. While event handling, messaging, and processing are not necessarily brand new concepts, the recent emergence in hardware such as virtualizations, multi-core processors, and so on, are in fact pushing the envelope in software design and development, elevating it to higher levels of capabilities never seen before. In the case of streaming which very often leverages on the underlying messaging mechanism(s) to bring distributed messaging to higher forms of purposes, such as IoT/IIoT applications, AI/ML data pipelines, or even eCommerce recommendations, event streaming platform has indeed become the “glue” in enabling data to flow through disparate systems in the pipeline and in a very dynamic fashion.\r\n\r\nThis talk on event streaming is meant for anyone interested in learning about it, and understanding how it fits into the modern software development design and architecture, as well as seeing some of the challenges it faces especially in the Cloud Native environment. We’ll then take a look at an open source platform - Apache Pulsar, which is poised to become the de facto new generation of distributed messaging and streaming platform that will bring joy to developers, and enable systems and applications to be highly responsive with its true real-time capabilities.",

What if you have to upgrade your code following the latest ECMAScript specifications? Updating hundreds of thousands of files by hand seems not the best possible option, so here comes the concept of codemods. In this talk, we will see how JavaScript gets interpreted, transformed, and eventually compiled so that refactoring a large codebase won't be a problem anymore.",

            "description": "Microservices are increasingly the standard architecture for Java-based applications in the cloud, but JVM warmup time can pose limitations, especially when scaling up new instances in response to load changes. Native images provide a solution by eliminating warmup through statically compiled code, resulting in a faster startup. However, this approach may lead to slower overall performance due to the absence of JIT optimizations at runtime. The CRaC project by OpenJDK offers an alternative. It captures and stores a snapshot of the running JVM, allowing for restoration later or on another machine. This session provides an overview of CRaC and presents results from a proof of concept.",

Demos will be using React, but the TDD concepts apply to any language or framework.",

            "description": "One of the core tenets of good design is simplicity, but what if your stuff just isn't that simple? What do you do when you have a 30-column table, mountains of metrics, bushels of button actions, or a ton of text fields that need to be shown?  What do you do when stakeholders push for bold text, colors, animations, and icons to make certain data stand out on an already cluttered screen? What happens when a design started simple but as new features keep getting added, so does button after button?\r\n\r\nAsh has been designing around complexity for over a decade. In this talk, they will share their tips on how to triage each element of data on the screen to determine priority, purpose, and decision points. They'll also share some tips and tricks on patterns and component ideas to help you better layout your UIs and workflows. \r\n Some things cannot be made simple, but they can be made better.",

But how can you make sure that we only allow systems that we trust to reach Service Bus? How do we guarantee that these messages are encrypted? And how to assure that only authenticated users and applications can communicate with their own queues, topics, and subscriptions?\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn all about the various security mechanisms which Service Bus provides, and how you can leverage them to keep your messages secure. We will dive into a variety of topics, such as the differences between using Shared Access Signatures and Azure Active Directory, setting up the right level of network security, and leveraging encryption of your messages, both during transport and while they are being stored.\r\n\r\nYou should not have to worry about your message security, but instead focus on bringing value to your solutions. After attending this session you will know exactly how to secure your messages and when to leverage specific security mechanisms. \r\n",

None of these tools capture the imagination more than Neural Networks. However, as our libraries become more robust, few people really understand what's going on behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThe inner workings of Neural Networks are surprisingly simple. While there may be a lot of math, it's not really hard math. To prove this, we're going in write and train a Neural Network, from scratch, live, in the session. Of course, I'll explain everything along the way.",

To avoid this, aircraft worldwide constantly and publicly broadcast their location, heading, and all sorts of other data using a system called ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast.\r\n\r\nThis data is a natural fit for a streaming architecture. After all, it’s a constant stream of data that is literally being broadcast in real-time. But how can we capture these broadcasts and the data within? Surely it must require expensive hardware and special tools!\r\n\r\nNot so much. It turns out that we can capture ADS-B data easily using a combination of a cheap radio dongle and free software—a combination called software-defined radio. From there we can store it in a streaming data structure and consume, transform, and publish it using microservices. Cool, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn how software-defined radio works (and not just for ADB-S), how to receive and store ADS-B data in streams, and how to use those streams with microservices. And, I’ll do it all by example—building a dashboard showing real-time flight data using Node.js, Redis Streams, and whatever front-end JavaScript framework happens to be popular that day!",

Does it feel like you are constantly writing the same code repeatedly? Volatility and tight coupling are likely part of your problem.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discuss techniques to detect and isolate volatility in your software architecture (and requirements).  By isolating volatility in your architecture, teams will be able to better decouple components, test the system and offer protection from changing requirements. We will also discuss how to apply these techniques to existing legacy applications and when designing new applications and/or services. In addition, the session will cover some guidelines and warning signs that you are over-designing/engineering your solution.\r\n\r\nWhether you are new to being a software/solutions architect or have 20 years of experience, this session is sure to spark hot debate and engaging conversations. This session “may” touch on some controversial architectural concepts/ideas; we encourage you to be interactive and vocal!\r\n",

            "description": "Over the past few decades, agile software development as a mindset has changed the industry from top to bottom. Delivering working feature increments on a regular schedule is now the expected model for high performance software engineering organizations. \r\n\r\nHowever - some features are bigger than what can be accomplished in one sprint. And moreover, what happens when a code deployment causes performance degradation and needs to be rolled back, and quickly? How can features deployment be controlled safely and with confidence? What if you wanted to deploy a feature to just a small subset of your users? Or a big subset?\r\n\r\nEnter the humble feature flag. These booleans as a service can wrap code and be used to target what code gets released, and to whom. They allow for nearly instantaneous rollbacks and ramp-ups of feature deployments, slicing and dicing a user base in a multitude of ways. \r\n\r\nExcited to learn more? \r\n\r\nJoin me in this session as I discuss the finer points of feature flagging.

The world-famous hockey player Wayne Gretzky, when asked what made him different than all the other players, famously said, \"I didn't skate to where the puck was--I skated to where the puck would be.\" In this presentation, we're going to take a look at a few languages that incorporate concepts that might--with heavy emphasis on the word \"might\" in that sentence--be where the puck will figuratively end up. These languages may not be what you end up using in your day job in 2025, but they could be exposing and refining the concepts that define the language that will.",

            "description": "It happens to all of us.  You have built your backlog, the tasks are all in order, everyone is committed to the work.  Everyone feels great about a backlog well planned and is ready to get to work.  And then someone does it, they use the ‘E’ word.  “What is our estimate for this?”.  A chorus of groans breaks out.  Suddenly, two developers come to fisticuffs over the difference between a 2-point and a 3-point story.  The SDET storms out because we haven’t included enough time for testing.  The Product Owner climbs on the table to start preaching the difference between accuracy and precision.  Join this season and learn how to avoid this scene, or the groan factor, at your next planning without giving up the value of estimates.  In this session we will learn: \r\n•\tWhy “the business” wants estimates and how to make sure they aren’t abused\r\n•\tWhy the development team should want estimates and how to reduce the trauma\r\n•\tUsing estimates now to avoid disappointment and overtime later\r\n•\tAccuracy vs Precision, Story points vs t-shirt sizes, and all the ways we do this wrong\r\n•\tWhen to estimate, who to estimate with, and how to keep it all for being a lie\r\n",

Set up is easy, the API is great and well documented, yet we’ve all seen tests written for code coverage rather than functionality. Testing code correctly is just as challenging as writing the actual code and should be given the time and attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nThis talk will showcase some real life tests via a boilerplate application, showing how to test API calls, functions, UI components and async code. We’ll look at some real test cases I’ve encountered that while passing, were actually broken. You’ll come out of this talk with better patterns and tips for testing real web applications and maybe some motivation for writing tests.\r\n",

            "description": "After the events of the last several years, burnout has been on everyone’s minds. Are you feeling nostalgia for the days when your job wasn’t such a hassle? Do you find yourself struggling to care about your job… or anything at all? You may be wrestling with burnout.. But what exactly IS burnout? If you’re dealing with it, what do you do about it, or how do you talk to someone else about it?\r\n\r\nCome and get a glimpse beneath the surface of this phenomenon in this talk pulling from both personal experiences and psychological studies. You’ll learn the basics of burnout... and also what sorts of situations lead to it, how it can intertwine with other mental challenges including trauma, and why fixing it isn’t just as simple as taking time off work. Most importantly, you’ll learn things you can start doing tomorrow to bounce back from burnout, and how you can even help prevent it for yourself and others.",

            "description": "Building operable software is becoming more important with the adoption of Microservice based systems becoming more common. Developers are increasingly relying on building long-running \"integration\" tests in deployed environments because it's the only way to gain confidence to deploy their applications.  There is a better way, which is to focus on \"outside-in\" testing that focuses on testing the boundaries of your service.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll go through some of the pitfalls of relying on unit testing to give you confidence in an application.  We'll then go through how you can use TDD as a workflow to build tests in a \"Contract First\" way and how much more flexible your testing becomes. We'll talk about the benefits over Unit testing focus, and how it can aid in understanding service boundaries.  Finally, we'll show you can correlate all this up with Tracing tools like Honeycomb to see the performance of your tests and how internal code interacts.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be focusing on the WebApplicationFactory in .NET to provide the scaffold, and Honeycomb to provide the visibility, however, the concepts will likely apply to other languages.",

And, in 2020, SolarWinds caused a security leak that affected over 33,000 customers, amongst them the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Treasury: an attack to the software supply chain of their software Orion was successful and let to malicious software to be distributed to many of their clients.\r\n\r\nIncidents like this proof that application security is not just security testing before you ship your software or architecture reviews. Security must be baked into your development process and if must span the entire software supply chain.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you’ll learn how you can integrate security into your complete development process:\r\n-\tSecure development environments\r\n-\tSecret scanning and secret rotation\r\n-\tDependency management and software composition analysis (SCA)\r\n-\tManage your software supply chain with Dependabot\r\n-\tFind XSS, SQL injection, and memory leaks\r\n-\tStatic and dynamic security testing (SAST and DAST)\r\n-\tHunt for vulnerabilities writing your own CodeQL queries\r\n\r\nThe talk is for everyone that is interested in application security – developers as well as DevOps engineers.

Because successful machine learning needs a team of people with different skills—and you're only one person. How do you get started with machine learning? Do you need to go back to school to relearn mathematics and statistics? Do you need to study all the processes, algorithms, hyperparameters, and whatever is related to machine learning? Luckily there is no cause for panic. There are plenty of options for easily starting with machine learning. We will discuss AutoML and AI services, and how to easily start with machine learning in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.",

This is a surprisingly common case in many large applications!\r\n\r\nCome learn how we diagnosed (and solved) performance problems with a high concurrency table on software that serves 170,000+ customers! You'll learn what we did, how tracing and logging helped, and how we held a blameless post-mortem after the initial incident. While every challenge with high concurrency is different, the strategies for tackling it are similar.",

            "description": "It seems like the dream of DevOps and CI/CD in today’s software world is to get to a point where you deploy to production 15 times a day. But, is that really feasible or necessary for your applications? \r\n\r\nToday, automation is not about speed of release, but about ensuring a smooth, painless operation. Teams utilize automation to ensure that when the time comes, they are ready and aren’t exposing risks or accidentally creating more steps. When teams are getting ready to deploy to production, they face a number of critical considerations, including:\r\n\r\n- Understanding dependencies between application downtimes and user frequency.\r\n- When is the right time to deploy with legacy code and understanding what internal systems are impacted.\r\n- Training, which adds time and resources. \r\n- Explaining new features and functions frequently making it difficult for anyone to keep up. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will walk through realistic goals and approaches to deploy to production faster and setting your team up for the potential to build once and deploy anywhere. We will discuss how creating smaller outage windows and only making small changes will help teams deliver faster while keeping systems and applications up and running.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, attendees will learn: \r\n- How to successfully deploy faster\r\n- How to automate deployments safely and efficiently\r\n- How to align your DevOps team for CI/CD optimization\r\n",

SNNs model the behavior of biological neurons by using spikes, or discrete events, to represent the activation of the neurons. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, SNNs can be processed using simple, low-power circuits, making them well-suited for use in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices, IoT sensors and robotics. This talk will provide an overview of the current state of SNNs, including their strengths, limitations, and open research questions, as well as provide examples of recent applications that demonstrate the potential of SNNs in various fields such as image recognition, speech recognition and robotics.",

It's event-driven architecture allows I/O operations to run concurrently while their associated callbacks are executed synchronously in the event loop. This, however, comes with a dark side in that CPU-bound operations are likely to block the event loop thus delaying when those callbacks are invoked. Fortunately, Node.js ships with several modules that allow us to offload those blocking CPU-bound operations from the main event loop so it's free to handle other tasks while the CPU-bound operations go about their business. Most notably we'll explore some ways in which the child_process and worker_threads modules can keep your Node.js application performant while still handling those CPU-intensive operations.",

In 2018, Danica moved to San Francisco and pivoted to backend engineering with a derivatives data team which was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that processes millions of financial market data per second in near real-time.

            "bio": "Julie Heckman has channeled a love for math that began with high school algebra and calculus into a career converting data into opportunities for insurance, healthcare, and financial services clients. With a Master of Arts degree in Mathematics from the University of Idaho, and earlier a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Math Education from the University of Missouri, she initially taught high school math. Spurred by an interest in the financial markets, she then joined an equities firm and later became a software developer who used Big Data to help stock traders evaluate their strategies, facilitating millions of stock trades annually.\r\n\r\nJulie later worked for agriculture and financial technology startups where she used Big Data, streaming and traditional databases to find, identify, and manage data, making it useful and actionable for peers and leaders. But as she also learned, working at a startup becomes less about discovery — and more about production and implementation — as the company scales and matures.\r\n\r\nEver curious, Julie came to Right Triangle Consulting in 2020 and now has years of experience using proven data engineering expertise to help clients migrate their data to cloud applications. There, the data’s integrity can be maintained or used for hypotheses testing, analysis and reporting.\r\n\r\nJulie enjoys working with a variety of client types to help them solve business problems. Often, she works with legacy data that needs to be cultivated for a specific purpose. For example, she and a peer collaborated with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and healthcare technology provider Vantage Technology, using their proprietary software combined with Azure Data Factory and Power BI. Working remotely, they gathered and analyzed data to help a nonprofit more efficiently deploy messaging designed to increase COVID-19 testing and vaccinations among residents in traditionally underserved communities.\r\n\r\nRecently, and as more consultants have joined Right Triangle, she’s taken her passion for discovery to a new level by seeking, finding, and testing emerging technologies to see if they’ll meet clients’ needs or complement legacy tools like Snowflake and Informatica. Increasingly, that includes reviewing new cloud-based and server-less solutions like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure, and other applications that are leading the future of data warehousing and management.\r\n\r\nTypical of Julie’s passion for precision is her zeal for math, budgeting, and recipes used in baking. A voracious reader, she devours thrillers and mysteries. Driven by a natural curiosity for numbers and analysis, Julie is bullish about the future of data management and the emerging technologies that can best serve Right Triangle’s clients.",
