# Agenda Table

In this exercise you will update `app/routes/agenda.$day.tsx` to display the agenda in a table. If you would like to display the agenda in a different way, go for it!

All the data you need is in `rooms`, and `timeSlots`.

`timeSlots` is returned from the `getTimeSlots` utility function. It contains a sorted array of the time slots, and the sessions in each time slot.

You can look at the current KCDC website for inspiration on how to display the agenda. https://www.kcdc.info/agenda

## Time slot utils

In `src/utils/timeSlots.ts` there are a few helpers which has some useful functions if you are creating an agenda table with the same style as the KCDC website.
